The Hospital Management System is a Python project that helps organize basic hospital 
operations using OOP, a database, and a simple GUI and SQlite. The system allows 
patients to view doctors, book appointments, and see their prescriptions and bills. Doctors 
can log in, view their patients, create appointments, and write prescriptions. Staff can 
make offline booking and administrative tasksAll information is saved in an SQLite 
database, and the interface is built using Tkinter. The project aims to make hospital tasks 
easier, more organized, and accessible through a clean and interactive application.
