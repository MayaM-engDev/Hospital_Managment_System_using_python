patients to view doctors, book appointments, and see their prescriptions and bills. Doctors 
can log in, view their patients, create appointments, and write prescriptions. Staff can

database, and the interface is built using Tkinter. The project aims to make hospital tasks 
easier, more organized, and accessible through a clean and interactive application.
